### Professional Statement -- Cybersecurity

#### The world of Cybersecurity is challenging. It allows you to look at things on a deeper level, and from different perspective. You can only hack something if you know the system up close. To break something, you first need to know how it was built in the first place. This type of thinking resonates with me and I want to develop it further. I also want to see myself with better written and verbal communication style as well as a better programmer. 

Curiosity, and learning is what I value the most but not if it disturbs someone and invades their privacy.

If I understand how a system works, I can help protect it or in situations of breach, I can find the source of the problem. With this goal in mind I want to keep learning and enter in this fascinating world of cybersecurity.
