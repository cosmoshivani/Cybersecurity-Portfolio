I'll keep refining these answeres later

1. I have a background in physics, and I am very much interested in reading and writing. I love a beautifully crafted sentence, a well thought-out story, an interesting character in a book or a series, monologues of a character, and I am also in love with the diversity of species and the existence of it all.
2. I believe that I can learn things faster. I have previously worked as a content writer and I want to transition into a more technical role by accumulating more technical skills.
3. The thing I value most is peace, and I believe instead of choosing violence you can just isolate yourself and not cause harm to anyone. That's what people should do. I am overwhelemed sometimes by the things happening in the world. And I feel disheartened that whether anything is ever going to change but the only thing we can wish to change or are in control of is our own individualistic choices.
