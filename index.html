      <h2>Professional Statement -- Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>The world of Cybersecurity is challenging. It allows you to look at things on a deeper level. It forces you to look at the same system differently, from different perspectivs. You can only hack something if you know the system up close. To break something, you first need to know how it was built in the first place. This type of thinking resonates with me and I want to develop it further. I also want to see myself with better written and verbal communication style. I also want to know my around common security tools, terminologies, and scripting. Therefore I also want to sometimes think like a programmer.
Curiosity, and learning is what I value the most but not if it disturbs someone and invades their privacy.

If I understand how a system works, I can help protect it or in the situations of attack or breach, I can be of assistance (in one of the cybersecurity career roles that I have yet to decide but choice is just an illusion as it is said I know what I want) in finding the source of the problem. With this goal in mind I want to keep learning and enter in this fascinating world of cybersecurity.
